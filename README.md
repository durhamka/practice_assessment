##Stories to Implement

* As a user, I can add the publication date when adding a magazine.
 The date is visible on the show page. (spec pending)

* As a user, I can edit the the magazine name from the show page. (please write the spec for this)

##Bug Fix

There is a bug in the ads for the magazines! All of the ads for the magazine are
showing up for the magazine, rather than just the ones that have purchased ad
space. This cannot be. Please fix ASAP!
